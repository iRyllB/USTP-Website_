## Installation

To set up the project locally:

```bash
git clone git clone https://github.com/GDGustp/USTP-Website.git
cd USTP-Website
npm install
```

Rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill with the appropriate values. Please contact me for this.

However, If you want to create your own supabase instance, copy and execute all .sql files on `/sql` directory to supabase sql editor to setup RLS and table policies.


## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will launch the website locally at `http://localhost:5000/` (or whatever port is set on `.env`). Any changes made to the source code will trigger a live reload of the site.

For production builds, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a production-ready version of the website in the `build` folder.

## CMS Development

CMS Admin interface is accessible in `/admin` endpoint. [HERE](https://GDG-ustp.vercel.app/admin/login)

The CMS provides a secure admin interface for managing content:
- Event Management: Create, update, and delete events
- Blog Posts: Rich text editor with image upload support
- User Management: Control access levels and permissions
- Dashboard: Overview of content and activities

## Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variables to be set in the `.env` file:

### TinyMCE Integration

The application uses TinyMCE for rich text editing in the admin interface. The configuration is centralized in `src/lib/tinymceConfig.js`. 

Important notes:
- A valid TinyMCE API key is required (`REACT_APP_TINYMCE_API_KEY` in the `.env` file)
- You can obtain a free API key from [TinyMCE Cloud](https://www.tiny.cloud/auth/signup/)
- The implementation is compatible with TinyMCE 7.x
- Several deprecated plugins from older versions have been removed

If you encounter TinyMCE errors, verify that:
1. You have a valid API key
2. The environment variable is correctly loaded
3. You're using supported plugins (check `src/lib/tinymceConfig.js`)

## Scripts

- `npm start`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the production-ready version of the site.
- `npm run test`: Runs the test suite (if available).
- `npm run eject`: Ejects the project from `create-react-app` (use with caution).
